# Aircraft Accident Analysis: Exploring Safety and Risk Factors

## Overview
### This project analyzes aviation accident data to help a company entering the aviation industry identify the safest aircraft models and understand key risk factors. Using a dataset from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), we investigate how factors such as aircraft make, weather conditions, flight phases, and injury severity impact accident outcomes.

## Business Understanding
### The goal is to provide actionable insights to guide decisions about which aircraft models to purchase for commercial and private use. By identifying the most frequent aircraft involved in accidents and analyzing the severity of those accidents, we can help the business make data-driven safety decisions.

## Data Understanding and Analysis
### -Aircraft Makes: Cessna, Piper, and Beechcraft are the most common makes involved in accidents, although this may be due to their market dominance rather than inherent safety issues.
### -Weather Conditions: Accidents occurring in IMC (poor weather) tend to result in more fatalities compared to those in VMC (clear weather).
### -Flight Phases: The majority of accidents occur during landing and takeoff, while en route accidents are more likely to be fatal.
### -Injury Severity & Aircraft Damage: There is a strong correlation between the level of aircraft damage and the severity of injuriesâ€”more severe damage typically results in more fatal accidents.

## Conclusion
### Invest in Cessna and Piper models with good safety records.
### Enhance safety protocols for flights in IMC conditions.
### Focus on improving landing and takeoff procedures to reduce accidents.
